A tool that create a database with all post and comments that your enemy wrote in specific Facebook group

If you have not enamies you are lucky, then you can create a database in order to analyze any word o name in some Facebook group.
For example you can get into a vegan group and search the word "cow" and then check why vegans are tolking about a cow?
or another example can be to localize "bootim" like trolls, you can study the behaivor of specific person in your city's group.

The purpose that drive me to create this code was investigate someone who harasses to who criticizes the municipality of my city.
The results show me that this person works for the municipality and the terror is part of his work. 
i'm not the only that suffered from his violence.
