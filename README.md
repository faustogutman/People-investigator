# People-investigator in FB
People-investigator is a tool that creates a database with all post and comments where some name (or every simple word also) is mentioned in specific Facebook group that you are a a member.

<b>Technical issues:</b>
If you wanna understand the code you should have some knowledge in html, css, javascript and a good knowledge in <B>Python</B>

In the future facebook might change the classes name of some elements, or css selectors.
in this case you can find by yourself  the new names by inspect in the page.


thank you and use this code with responsibility.
