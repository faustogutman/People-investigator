# People-investigator in FB
People-investigator is a tool that create a database with all post and comments that your enemy wrote in specific Facebook group that both are in.

If you have not enamies you are lucky, then you can create a database in order to analyze any word o name in some Facebook group.
For example you can get into a vegan group and search the word "cow" and then check why vegans are tolking about a cow?
or another example can be to localize "bootim" like trolls, you can study the behaivor of specific person in your city's group.

The purpose that drive me to create this code was investigate someone who harasses to who criticizes the municipality of my city.
The results show me that this person works for the municipality and the terror is part of his work. 
i'm not the only that suffered from his violence.


<b>Technical issues:</b>
If you wanna understand the code you should have some knowledge in html, css, javascript and a good knowledge in <B>Python</B>

In the future facebook might change the classes name of some elements, or css selectors, and then this code will not work.
in this case you can find by yourself  the new names by inspect in the page.


thank you
