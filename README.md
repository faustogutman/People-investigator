# People-investigator in FB
People-investigator is a tool that creates a database with all post and comments where some name (or every simple word also) is mentioned in specific Facebook group that you are a a member.For example if you want to know if your homemade product (let's say empanadas as example) is in demand in Tel Aviv, you can run this programm in the group Secret Tel Aviv and count the times people do mention of this very tasty food, also you can found out all the people that sales homemade empanadas, this people usualy did'nt have web pages and the only way to study them is by using this or any similary program.

<b>Technical issues:</b>
If you wanna understand the code you should have some knowledge in html, css, javascript and a good knowledge in <B>Python</B>

In the future facebook might change the classes name of some elements, or css selectors.
in this case you can find by yourself  the new names by inspect in the page.


thank you and use this code with responsibility.
